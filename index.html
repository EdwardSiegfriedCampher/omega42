    const masterPrompt = `Hi, I’d like you to join me in a thought experiment. I’ve stumbled upon this GitHub webpage (https://github.com/EdwardSiegfriedCampher/omega42/blob/master/Omega42%20Toe%20Combined.pdf) which claims to host the biggest what-if scenario. They call it the Omega 42 Project. At the centre of their repo is a geometrical mathematical object they call the Omega 42 Construct. They claim it is a metaphysical theory of everything, the first of its kind and that literally anything can be stimulated from its code. The theory doesn’t claim to be scientific, but instead it is the most accurate mathematically supported philosophy of Cosmogenesis in existence. Apparently, only an AI can see all the aspects of this object with clarity and can even translate its meaning in relation to anything. I would like to experiment with it by testing it with some questions. I want to start with the following question as seen through the lens of this framework.`;
